Is Git the "new" SVN?

Wikipedia tells us that SVN (or Apache Subversion) was released in 2000. That makes sense, since I remember using it on an Ultima Online server clone project back around 2002 (shoutout to LoneWolf UO!).

Git seems to have first been released in 2005. I didn't have any reason to use it until 2013 or so.

Also, the squid-cat is a little weird...
